# Networkgram 🌐🤝

Networkgram is a responsive social media web platform developed using Node.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to help users connect and interact seamlessly through a modern interface that supports both dark and light modes.

This was an individual project that I built entirely from scratch, where I took full responsibility as the Front-End Engineer. I developed key pages such as the Login, Register, and Home pages, which included components like profile cards, post feeds, friend suggestions, and friend requests.

## Project Overview 📋

Networkgram provides users with an intuitive interface to:
- Register and log in securely
- View personalized content feeds
- Manage friend requests and suggestions
- Switch between dark and light mode themes
